# Weather-Forecast
Internship Project at NIT Patna.

# Abstract
In this project I was required to develop an android application which can provide an accurate present climate condition in and around our current city with 
appropriate user interface. In addition to it, this application can also provide the weather forecast for next upcoming 5 days at every 3 hours interval. 

# Introduction
I developed this weather forecasting application using the APIs offered on OpenWeatherMap. When we log into this application, 
we first encounter location permission prompt asking us to allow access to the device’s location. 
When the permission is granted and our GPS is ON then we come to our home page where we can see various climate information for the current location 
such as temperature, pressure, humidity, etc. In case permission is granted but our GPS is turned OFF then it automatically opens the device’s 
settings where one can ON the device’s GPS. This all you can visualize with appropriate graphics used.

# API-Used
